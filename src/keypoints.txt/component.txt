A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. 
That job is often to render some HTML.

***code**
import React from 'react';//This is imported object that contains methods that you need in order to use React.The object is called the React library
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';// methods imported from 'react-dom' are meant for interacting with the DOM

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
