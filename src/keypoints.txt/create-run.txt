*App Structure*
(1).gitignore
    This is the standard file used by the source control tool git to determine which files and directories to ignore when committing code.

(2)package.json
    This file outlines all the settings for the React app
    . name-is name of your app
    .version-is current version
    .'private':true-is a failsafe setting to avoid accidentally publishing your app as a public package within the npm ecosystem.
    . dependencies contains all the required node modules and versions required for the application.
            it contains two dependencies, which allow us to use react and react-dom in our JavaScript.
(3)node_modules-This directory contains dependencies and sub-dependencies of packages used by the current React app, as specified by package.json
(4) package-lock.json-This file contains the exact dependency tree installed in node_modules/. 
    This provides a way for teams working on private apps to ensure that they have the same version of dependencies and sub-dependencies. It also contains a history of changes to package.json, so you can quickly look back at dependency changes.
(5) public-This directory contains assets that will be served directly without additional processing by webpack. index.html provides the entry point for the web app.
(6) src-This contains the JavaScript that will be processed by webpack and is the heart of the React app.
